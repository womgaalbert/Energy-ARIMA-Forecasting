# Energy-ARIMA-Forecasting
This project applies time series analysis and ARIMA/SARIMA modeling to forecast U.S. industrial energy production (1939â€“2025). Using historical data from the Federal Reserve (FRED), it identifies long-term trends, seasonality patterns, and generates a 36-month forecast.
