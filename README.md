# Energy-ARIMA-Forecasting
This project applies time series analysis and ARIMA/SARIMA modeling to forecast U.S. industrial energy production (1939‚Äì2025). Using historical data from the Federal Reserve (FRED), it identifies long-term trends, seasonality patterns, and generates a 36-month forecast.

# Forecasting U.S. Energy Production with ARIMA

## üìå Project Overview
This project uses **time series analysis** and **ARIMA modeling** to forecast monthly U.S. industrial energy production (1939‚Äì2025).  
We perform decomposition, stationarity checks, and SARIMA modeling to predict energy demand.
